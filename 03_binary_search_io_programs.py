"""
You are given a list nums of length n + 1 picked from the range 1, 2, ..., n. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a duplicate. Find and return it. There is guaranteed to be exactly one duplicate.

Bonus: Can you do this in linear time and constant space?

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000
Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
