# Binarysearch.io

binarysearch is a free site where you can work on coding and algorithms problems together with others.

The great thing about this site is that it doesn’t have any locked problems. It’s very light to use and the problem statements are very concise and up to the point. 
Also you can earn badges depending on the quality/quantity of problems that you solve. The very idea of solving a problem in a room within a limited time frame along with your peers is great to evaluate yourself as compared to others. The collection of problems are of great quality and will definitely help you in clearing technical interviews of biggies.

Hope it helps !!!
